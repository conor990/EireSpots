                            <p>This website is an ongoing project, currently being improved and updated. This website was created  to outline some cool and aesthetic places to visit in Ireland, that I believe deserve some recognition. I came up with this idea as it occured to me that many of these placed may not survive the covid-19 pandemic without some extra attention and new customers. This is my way of trying to do my part to help these businesses.</p>
